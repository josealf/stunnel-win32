# stunnel-win32

What is this?
This is a user provided binary release of Michal Trojnara's Stunnel TLS Proxy software compiled for Windows 32-bit.

Why is this needed?
The official stunnel.org site no longer provides 32-bit binaries for Windows. This is provided as a convenience for stunnel users.
 
 How does this differs form the official installer?
 The software should be mostly compatible with the official binaries. The binaries for Stunnel and OpenSSL were generated with GCC 7.3 or later for i686 architecture. Small tweaks were made to the NSIS install script to accomodate DLL file name changes.
